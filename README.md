This project is a simple ChatBot application built using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The ChatBot can respond to basic predefined questions and user inputs.

Features
Responds to common questions like greetings, time, and weather.
Uses a simple text-based interface.
Easily extendable to add more responses.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 8 or higher)
Java IDE (Optional but recommended)
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-chatbot.git
cd java-chatbot

2. Compile the Java Code
Navigate to the directory where the ChatBot.java file is located and compile the Java program using the command:
javac ChatBot.java

3. Run the Application
After compiling, run the application with the following command:
java ChatBot

4. Interact with the ChatBot
A GUI window will open where you can interact with the ChatBot. Type your questions or statements in the text field at the bottom and hit Enter. The ChatBot will respond based on the predefined responses.

Code Overview
ChatBot Class
The ChatBot class extends JFrame and serves as the main window for the application.

Key Components:
a)JTextField textField: For user input.
b)JTextArea textArea: To display the conversation.
c)Map<String, String> responses: A collection of predefined responses.

Methods:
a)initializeResponses(): Initializes the responses map with common questions and their corresponding answers.
b)getResponse(String input): Fetches the appropriate response based on the user input.
c)appendChat(String message): Appends text to the chat area in the GUI.


Extending the ChatBot
To extend the ChatBot's capabilities:
a)Add more key-value pairs to the responses map in the initializeResponses() method.
b)Implement additional logic in the getResponse(String input) method for more complex interactions.
